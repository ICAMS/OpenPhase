This is a README file for the SingleGrain simulation example.

In order to run the example simulation you should run ./SingleGrain.
/ProjectInput directory contains the necessary input file for the simulation.
Results will be placed in to the /VTK directory and can be visualised
using ParaView (www.paraview.org).

A detailed description of the simulation setup is given in the SingleGrain.txt file.

For a comparison we provide several snapshots of the simulation box at different time steps.
They can be found in the /Figures directory.
