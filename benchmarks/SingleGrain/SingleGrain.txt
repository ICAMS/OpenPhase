Single grain example

A spherical grain of phase 1 surrounded by phase 0 is considered. The grain is
placed in the center of a cubic box with zero-gradient boundary conditions. No
driving force is applied.

The box size is 51x51x51 grid points. The input parameters are:

initial grain radius: R_0   = 20 grid points, 
grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-6} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-5} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 4*10^{-10} m^4/(J*s), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.24 J/m^2, 
interface width:      eta   = 5*dX.

After the start of the simulation, the curved interface begin to shrink in
order to minimize the interface energy. The grain retains its sperical shape 
while the radius decreases with time.

The output data in vtk format is written in the VTK directory and can be directly 
visualized using Paraview software (www.paraview.org). 

The Size_t_graph.dat file contains the values of the time step and the particle radius.

For the grain boundary evolution when particle radius R << eta, an approximate 
theoretical time dependence of the grain radius can be obtained

R^2 = R_0^2 - 4*mu*sigma*t,

The example simulation should reproduce this dependence.

Figures in the /Figures directory show the grain at time (in time steps) t=10000 (R=39.53*dX), 
20000 (R=29.72*dX), and t=40000 (R=12.93*dX) .
