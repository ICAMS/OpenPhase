This is a README file for the Multiple Junction benchmark.

In order to run the benchmark simulation you should run ./MultiJunction. 
/ProjectInput directory contains the necessary input file for the simulation. 
Results will be placed in to the /VTK directory and can be visualised 
using ParaView (www.paraview.org).

A detailed description of the simulation setup is given in the MultiJunction.txt file.  

For a comparison we provide several snapshots of the simulation box at different time steps. 
They can be found in the /Figures directory.
