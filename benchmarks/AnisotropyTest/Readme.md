# Grand Potential Anisotropy Test
This is a simple test to verify the functionality of the cubic anisotropy
function with the additional derivatives which are obtained from the dependency
of the interface energy on the orientation of the interface.
Grand potential is used to simulate the solid-vapor interface of a single
grain.
