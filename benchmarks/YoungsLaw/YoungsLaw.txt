Youngs Law benchmark description

Three phase-field regions representing rigid body surface, gas and liquid droplet are 
initiated in the box in order to check the Young's angles at the contact between them.
The liquid droplet is allowed to evaporate, so its volume is not conserved.
All interface energies are identical by default but interface energies can be changed 
to study the contact angle dependence on the interface energy difference.

The box size is 101x1x101 grid points. The input parameters are:

grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-6} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-4} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 4*10^{-10} m^4/(J*s) (or 0 for rigid body surface), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.24 J/m^2, 
interface width:      eta   = 5*dX.

Insulating (adiabatic) boundary conditions are used in the simulation. After the start of the 
simulation the dropel gas interface begin to evolve according to the surface tension balance at the
contact between all three phases. Depending on the actual interface energy values, the 
liquid droplet evolution would lead to different contact angles between the droplet and the
rigid surface. Wikipedia article on Surface Energy provides more information on the Young's law
and the contact angle.

The output data in vtk format is written in the VTK directory and can be 
directly visualized using the Paraview software (www.paraview.org).
