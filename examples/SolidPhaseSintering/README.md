# Solid Phase Sintering


Solid-state sintering is the bonding and densification of particles by the
application of heat below the melting point of a material. During sintering,
the free surface area of the compact decreases, and this is normally accompanied
by an increase in the density.

The example initializes a dense rectangular green body consistent of spherical
particles of random size and position. These particles then undergo solid-state
sintering.
