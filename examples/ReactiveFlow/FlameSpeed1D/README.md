Flow simulation example
=======================

How to run
----------
In order to run the example simulation you should run Flow. ProjectInput.opi
contains the necessary date for the simulation. Results will be placed in to
the /VTK directory and can be visualised using ParaView (www.paraview.org).

What is simulated
-----------------
A spherical grain of phase 1 surrounded by phase 0 is considered. The grain is
placed in the center of a cubic box with gravity acting in the negative
x-direction.
