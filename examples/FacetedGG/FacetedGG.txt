Faceted grain growth example (FacetedGG)

The simulation domain is populated with a set of grains generated according to 
the Vornoi algorithm. No thermodynamic driving force is applied to the grain 
boundaries, thus only the effect of the interface curvature and anisotropic 
interface energy is considered in the simulation.

After the start of the simulation, the grains begin to grow minimizing the 
interface area. The simulation output data in vtk format is written in the 
VTK directory and can be directly visualized using the ParaView software 
(www.paraview.org).
