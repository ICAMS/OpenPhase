Normal grain growth example (NormalGG)

The simulation domain is populated with a set of grains generated according to 
the Vornoi algorithm. The routine which is used to generate granes utilizes
the voro++ library. No thermodynamic driving force is applied to the grain 
boundaries, thus only the effect of the interface curvature is active during 
simulation.

The box size is 51x51x51 grid points. The input parameters are:

Initial number of grains:  25, 
grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-6} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-5} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 4*10^{-10} m^4/(J*s), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.24 J/m^2, 
interface width:      eta   = 3.5*dX.

After the start of the simulation, the grains begin to grow minimizing the interface area.
The simulation output data in vtk format is written in the VTK directory and can be directly 
visualized using the Paraview software (www.paraview.org).
